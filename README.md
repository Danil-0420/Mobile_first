_The Mobile First strategy, as the name implies, involves designing the interface of the site, primarily focused on mobile devices. The philosophy of the approach is to prototype the design for the smallest screen first, and then move on to larger displays. This is the main difference from the classic Desktop First approach that web professionals have been using for many years._
